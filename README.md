Dragon Fractal Animation (Rotation Method)
===================

> ##### 1. Problem to Solve
> - Constructing the particular sets of points, of which, when connected form an iteration.

> ##### 2. Animating each iteration
> - Between each iteration, make duplicate of a shape, and rotate the duplicate about the last point of the generated points.
> - After animation, display the successive fractal on screen without delay
> - For following iteartion, repeat the same process
